Programming language - Java 20.0.2

How the code is structured?

i)Initially ,take the input from the command prompt. The input includes FileName, Number of Red tokens, Number of Blue tokens, Type of Version, First Player & Depth of the search tree and uses the MinMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the best move for the computer.
ii)The minMaxAlphaBeta function takes the number of Red and Blue tokens, a boolean indicating whether the current player is maximizing or minimizing, the current depth, and the alpha and beta values, and uses the MinMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the best move for the current player.
iii)The game allows the Computer & Human to make moves until either the red or blue pile is empty.
iv)Once the Game Ends, the redBlueNim function calculates the final scores for both players based on the remaining marbles, and declares the winner.

How to run the code?

Type the following command to execute the program from command prompt:
javac RedBlueNim.java
java RedBlueNim.java 3 4 (or) java RedBlueNim.java 3 4 misere (or) java RedBlueNim.java 3 4 standard computer 
                         (or) java RedBlueNim.java 3 4 standard computer 2
