The task is to create an agent to play two versions (standard and misere) of the variant of a game called red-blue marble against a human player.
The game consists of two piles of marbles (red and blue). 
On each players turn they pick a pile and remove one marble from it. 
If on their turn, either pile is empty then they lose in the standard version and win in the mis√©re version. 
The amount they lose (or win) is dependent on the number of marbles left (2 for every red marble and 3 for every blue marble). 
So if on the computer player turn, it has 0 red marbles and 3 blue marbles, it loses 9 points in the standard version (or wins 9 points in the misere version).
